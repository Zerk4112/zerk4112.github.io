## Description

This was my very first game jam entry, and it was an incredibly enjoyable experience! At the time, I was unaware that [Tom Hall](https://twitter.com/ThatTomHall), known for his contributions to Doom, organized regular game jams. The one I stumbled upon was the [RNDGAME2021 Jam](https://itch.io/jam/rndgame-jam-2), which had a unique twist.

For this jam, a PICO-8 program was used to randomly generate game titles. Participants' task was to create a game based on the title they received.

I was handed the title "Hyperspace Rodeo." Immediately, I envisioned a cowboy riding a horse that was riding a rocket through space. I knew I had to bring this concept to life.

"Hyperspace Rodeo" is a classic-style arcade game where your objective is to lasso as many cows as possible within a 2-minute time limit. The challenge lies in navigating through the fast-paced, intergalactic rodeo to secure your bovine prizes.


## Controls

### Movement

- Up, Down, Left and Right arrows control the player on the play field.

### Lasso

- Hold X key to prepare lasso.
- Release X to throw lasso
  - the longer you prepare to throw the lasso the further it will travel, as indicated by the lasso reticule.

### Rocket Boost

- Press O key to enter a small temporary boost
- Hold O key to enter Hyperspace
  - Player will remain in Hyperspace for as long as they hold the O key, though lassoing will be quite difficult!

## Score Modifiers

The velocity of the player affects the amount of score that awarded when a cow is lassoed.

- Normal speed = 50 pts
- Boost speed = 100 pts
- Hyperspace = 150 pts
