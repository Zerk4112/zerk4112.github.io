Hello, world!

I'm Zachariah Covington, also known as ZerkDev, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my GitHub page. Here, I'll be showcasing my projects and sharing documentation where applicable.

As an Automation Developer, Game Developer, and Musician, I'm on a constant quest to explore, learn, and create. Through this blog, I aim to provide valuable insights and experiences that I've gained on my journey.

Recently, I completed a PICO-8 project, and I'm excited to create a comprehensive write-up about it. One of my primary goals was to become more proficient with GitHub Copilot, and I must say, it proved exceptionally useful!

My next endeavor? Getting my home network up and running smoothly. We currently rely on a few mini-PCs serving as servers for various tasks, but it's a work in progress. There are some much-needed upgrades in the pipeline, and I'll be documenting the entire process.

Beyond that, I have plans to dive into another game project and a web app project. While the details of the web app project are still taking shape, I'm eager to see where this new venture will lead.

Stay tuned for more updates, tutorials, and insights into my tech and creative endeavors. I can't wait to share this exciting journey with you!
