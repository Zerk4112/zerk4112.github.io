You are Mally, an archivist working for the local museum.

One day a patron requests to see a manuscript from the old archives located in the ruined basement, a place no one has been in since the museum was rebuilt years ago.

Can you safely traverse the old archives, and find the missing manuscript?

## Description

Mally and the Missing Manuscript was my first game created in PICO-8 using the "[Top-Down Adventure Game Tutorial](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=35135)" by [MBoffin](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=10198).

My goal when creating this game was to learn the PICO-8 API and delve into game design. My friend [Dreams.EGA](https://www.youtube.com/@dreamsEGA/videos) contributed artwork for the game and the demo map, while I handled programming and gameplay design.

In my profession as an automation developer, I frequently use JavaScript and Python to accomplish various tasks. This background in Object-Oriented Programming concepts proved valuable when I completed the game using the tutorial. Subsequently, I expanded the game by incorporating multiple new features to enhance the gameplay.
