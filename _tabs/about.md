Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Zachariah Covington, known as ZerkDev, and I love technology and music.

## Interests and Expertise

I'm passionate about developing automation solutions. I work with VMWare Aria Automation at my job and tinker with Home Assistant, Node Red, and various microcontrollers in my spare time. Among these, the ESP-32 microcontroller holds a special place in my heart due to its versatility.

## YouTube Channels

I maintain two YouTube channels! 
- [ZerkDev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCppf0SWnRTaLEqE76jGRxXA)
  - Showcases various software development projects I am working on at the time, or even trailers or gameplay of games I release.
- [ZerkMusic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuKT9CFr6jiTONJgM22oaiw)
  - Showcases my musical endeavors. Whether you're interested in coding or grooving to some tunes, there's something for everyone.
